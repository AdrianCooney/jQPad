##Overview##
####Understanding how jQPad works####
jQPad has two viewports, one on the left for navigation and one on the right for content. The whole content system is based on AJAX calls to retrieve content from the 'content/' directory, unlike many of it's counterparts, which store all their content on the one page. (In future versions, there will be this option.)
